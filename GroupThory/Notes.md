## Introduction

1. 19th century：roots of polynomials.
2. 20th century: play a major role in physics.  the groups of diffeomorphism symmetries of manifolds.
3. since 1950s.  organize the zoo of subatomic particles,  formulate the Hamiltonian that governs interactions of elementary particles one must have some understanding of the theory of Lie algebras, Lie groups, and their representations.
4. late 20th and early 21st century.  essential in many areas of physics including atomic, nuclear, particle, and condensed matter physics.

### Equivalence Relations

> **Definition 1.1.1** Let X be any set. A binary relation ~ is an *equivalence relation* if $\forall a,b,c \in \bf{X}$
>
> 1. $a\sim a$
> 2. $a\sim b \Rightarrow b\sim a$
> 3. $a\sim b$ and $b\sim c \Rightarrow a\sim b$

**Example 1.1.1** ：$=$ 符合要求.
**Example 1.1.2** ：$\mathtt X = \mathbb A$, $a \sim b$,如果$a-b$为常数.

>**Definition 1.1.2** Let $\sim$ be an equivalence relation on $\mathtt X$. The *equivalence class* of an element $a$ is the subset 
>$$ [a]: =\{x \in \mathtt X: x\sim a\} \subset \mathtt X$$
